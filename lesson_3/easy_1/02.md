`!` is used in several contexts.
- It can be a shorthand for `not`, a logical operator.
- If used at the end of a method name, it usually indicates the method is destructive.
`?` is used in several contexts.
- It can be used as an operator (`? :`) in a ternary `if...else` expression.
- If used after a method name, it usually indicates a `true`/`false` value is returned.

That said, `!` or `?` at the end of method names is not Ruby syntax. You don't really know what the method is doing - it depends on the method implementation.

1. `!=` is the `not equal` comparison operator. It returns `true` if the left operand does not equal to the right operand.
2. Putting `!` before something (e.g `!user_name`) will return `false` is the object (e.g. `user_name`) is a truthy value.
~~3. Putting `!` after something (e.g. `words.uniq!`), in this case, a method, usually indicates that the method might be destructive. It will mutate the object passed to the method.~~
4. Putting `?` before something (e.g. `?1`) is a character literal notation. It will return a single character string (e.g. `'1'`).
~~5. Putting `?` after something (e.g. `1.is_a?(Integer)`), in this case, a method, usually indicates that the method might return a boolean value.~~
6. Putting `!!` before something (e.g. `!!user_name`) returns a boolean value. If the object is truthy, it will return `true`. Otherwise, it will return `false`.
