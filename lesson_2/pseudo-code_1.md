Write out pseudo-code for a method that returns the sum of two integers.

Casual pseudo-code:
```
Given two integers,

Initialize the current sum as zero.
Add the second integer to the first integer.
Assign the new sum as the current sum.

Return the current sum.
```

Formal pseudo-code:
```
START

# Given two integers, "number_1" and "number_2"

SET current_sum = 0
new_sum = number_1 + number_2
current_sum = new_sum

PRINT current_sum

END

```
