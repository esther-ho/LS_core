# Since the constant `FORMAT` is defined in the children of the class `File`, it is not in scope when `#to_s` is invoked on line 45 as a result of invoking `#puts`.
# This is because constants have lexical scope. A constant is only accessible if it is initialized in the surrounding structure of the method that references the it, or higher up the inheritance chain.
# To fix this error, we can explicitly reference the `FORMAT` constant defined by the subclass of current instance.
